          <p>As GeoNode continues grow, various institutional partners including the World Bank have expanded the number of deployments <a href="http://haitidata.org/">around</a> the <a href="http://geonode.sopac.org/">world</a> and are now looking to bring on partners to further support this growing project.</p>

          <p>Of particular interest are organizations skilled in deploying new instances and training personnel in using and administering GeoNode—especially those organizations with a presence in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Indonesia. If you or your organization is interested in partnering with the World Bank on opportunities related to GeoNode support or development then please email <strong>rsoden [at] worldbank [dot] org</strong> for more information.</p>

          <p>In addition to deployment and training partners, the GeoNode developer community is also ripe for growth and <a href="http://geonode.org/2011/06/become-a-geonode-developer/">OpenGeo is hiring</a> and <a href="http://geonode.org/2010/03/looking-for-partners/">looking for partners</a> to expand the pool of contributors to the project. If you or your organization is curious about committing to GeoNode as an open source project more generally then please participate on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geonode-dev/">developer list</a>.</p>
