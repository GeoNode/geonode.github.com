          <p>Many of us at OpenGeo have been eagerly working on GeoNode over the past few months.  As the number of organizations interested in the project increases, the time has come to bring more partners into the mix to further develop this growing project.</p>

          <p>Of particular interest are organizations with skills in cartography, web design, and graphic design—especially those with experience in Django, Pinax, GeoServer, and OpenLayers. Additionally, many prospective GeoNode users are interested in paper-based data collection workflows and greater OpenStreetMap integration.</p>

          <p>If you or your organization is interested in partnering with OpenGeo on opportunities related to GeoNode development and design, or are curious about committing to the GeoNode as an open source project then please don't hesitate to email <strong>seb [at] opengeo [dot] org</strong> for more information.</p>
