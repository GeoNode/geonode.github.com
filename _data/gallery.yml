- title: MapStory
  subtitle: MapStory Foundation
  description: MapStory, as a compliment to Wikipedia, is a new dimension to the global data commons that empowers a global user community to organize all knowledge about the world spatially and temporally. Just as Wikipedia uses a MediaWiki, MapStory uses a GeoNode.  Perhaps more important, MapStory is an infrastructure for enabling "MapStorytelling" as a means of communicating important issues to a global audience. In order to accomplish this, MapStory has sponsored temporal, social and narrative extensions to GeoNode. The goal is to enable any student, teacher or practitioner on Earth to tap the power of this new mode of conveying one's stories, arrayed across geography and as they unfold over time. MapStory will become the convening point where MapStorytellers of all kinds come to publish their expressions, and to critique each others' MapStories, leading to a consistently accumulating and improving global body of knowledge about global dynamics, worldwide, over the course of history.

- title: AWARE
  subtitle: Agricultural Web Atlas for REsearch
  description: "In Reunion Island the CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development) needed a platform to collect geographic data in order to share spatial data, facilitate access by its teams, and better communicate research results. Using GeoNode, AWARE (Agricultural Web Atlas for REsearch) meets these needs by providing a catalog of geospatial data available at CIRAD in Reunion Island. The atlas is based on a profile management to respect the rules of confidentiality and broadcasting rights. AWARE targets a wide audience : researchers, agricultural professionals, teachers, funders... Its strength lies in its ability to share spatial information through some said users 'contributors' who can add layers, create maps without using GIS software. It is also possible to link documents to layers and maps. Finally, the atlas uses free technology solutions that implement OGC standards (WMS, WCS, WFS and OWS) ensuring interoperability with GIS software such as ArcGIS or QGIS."
