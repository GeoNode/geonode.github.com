          <p><b>This Post is gonna kick things off by summarizing the latest releases 2.10.4 and GeoNode 3.</b></p>

          <p>Yeah, you understood correctly, there is a new major version out now. However, let's start at the beginning.<br><br>
          With the life of Python 2.7 ending in 2020 — it is a matter of course: GeoNode needing an overhaul for python 3 compatibilities.<br><br>
          To stick with clarity and precision, the development team has decided to give the new child a name as major version: GeoNode 3 was born!</p>

          <p>Alongside a lot of helping hands inside our community, two major contributors took the challenge in doing the main work on the Code Base of GeoNode 3.
            Namly Geosolutions (Italy) and Catalyst (New Zealand). The ladder being a relatively new contributor — concerning our community, and we'd love to see more
            contributions!</p>

            <b>To rule out any misunderstandings:</b><br><br>
            Whenever you see GeoNode 2.x make sure your Virtualenv uses Python 2.7.<br>
            In case you see a shining 3 at the end of GeoNode — you better check your Python Version to be 3.7.

          <h3>New Features</h3>
          <p>Next to Python 3, here’s one more shot:</p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 60px">Both releases fix several <i>minor</i>, <i>major</i> and <i>security</i> issues.<br>
          Thanks to GeoSolutions again, both Versions are now containing a great new feature called <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #1177A2">Geo Limits</span>, which limits Layer visibility based on an overlapping polygon.<br><br>

          Further, the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #1177A2">Backup-restore module</span> has been undertaken a full-on rework!<br><br>
          For all other great features added, do not miss to read both — the release note for <a href="https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/releases/tag/2.10.4">GeoNode 2.10.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/releases/tag/3.0">GeoNode 3!</a><br><br>
