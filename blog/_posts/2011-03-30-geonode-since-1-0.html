          <p>GeoNode's been evolving since the last 1.0 release through the contributions of a widening variety of partners.</p>

          <p><strong>The development team is very close to releasing GeoNode 1.0.1</strong>, which includes workflow improvements around data upload and management funded by UNISDR.  It also will have a number of bug fixes.  We will summarize these changes in the upcoming release announcement but for now you can see our <a href="http://dev.geonode.org/trac/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;milestone=1.0.x&amp;milestone=1.0.1">progress</a> on the GeoNode <a href="http://dev.geonode.org/trac">issue tracker</a>.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, we have been developing more substantial features in preparation for another release later on.  These include <strong>support for uploading large batches of data</strong> at once (as opposed to the currently supported single layer upload) and the <strong>integration of <a href="http://geowebcache.org/">GeoWebCache</a></strong>, which will greatly accelerate map loading.</p>

          <p>In addition, <a href="http://www.aifdr.org/aifdr_public_website/">AIFDR</a> has been leading development of applications that use GeoNode as a platform.  Most notable of these is <strong>Risiko, formerly Risk-in-a-Box, a risk modeling application</strong> which they are developing in partnership with <a href="http://www.gfdrr.org/gfdrr/Labs">GFDRR Labs</a> and <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo</a>.</p>

          <p>As GeoNode improves, we hope it will be attractive to a widening number of organizations and users. If
