	    				<h2>About GeoNode</h2>
		    			<p>
                            GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the management and publication of 
                            geospatial data. It brings together mature and stable open-source software projects under a consistent 
                            and easy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and create interactive maps.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map 
                            visualizations. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to 
                            only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the 
                            development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control 
                            of the data the GeoNode instance contains.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend, modify or integrate 
                            against to meet requirements in their own applications.

	    				<h2>Geospatial Data Storage</h2>
		    			<p>
                            GeoNode allows the user to upload vector (currently only Shapefiles) and raster data in their original 
                            projections using a web form. Vector data is uploaded in ESRI Shapefile format and satellite imagery 
                            and other kinds of raster data are uploaded as GeoTIFFs.
			    		</p>
				    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Special importance is given to standard metadata formats like ISO 19139:2007. After the upload is finished, 
                            the user is presented with a form to fill in the metadata and it is made available using a CSW interface. 
                            Users may also upload a metadata XML document (in ISO, FGDC, or Dublin Core format) to fill in key GeoNode 
                            metadata elements automatically.
                            <!-- TODO Add Image Here -->

                        <p>
                            Similarly, GeoNode provides a web based styler, that lets the user change how the data looks and 
                            preview the changes in real time.

    	    			<h2>Data mixing, maps creation</h2>
	    	    		<p>
                            Once the data has been uploaded, GeoNode lets the user search for it geographically or via keywords and 
                            create maps.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <p>
                            All the layers are automatically reprojected to web mercator for maps display, making it possible to use 
                            different popular base layers, like Open Street Map, Google Satellite or Bing layers.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Once maps are saved, it is possible to embed them in any webpage or get a PDF version for printing.

                            Several other Open Source projects extend GeoNode’s functionality by tapping into the re-usability of 
                            Django applications.

                        The GeoNode web interface is the primary method of interacting with GeoNode as a user. From this interface, one can 
                        view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other GeoNode users.
                        
                        Without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.

                        This page shows a variety of information about the current GeoNode instance. At the top of the page, a toolbar exists 
                        showing quick links to view layers, maps, documents (metadata), people ADD LINK, and a search field. Below this is a 
                        listing of recently updated layers, including abstract, owner, rating, and download button (if available).

					<h2>Explore Layers Page</h2>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This page shows all layers known to GeoNode, available in either List or Grid viewing. Layers can be sorted by 
                        Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Shared. Also available are a list of categories, with which layers can be 
                        connected with.

                        A layer viewing page will display, with the layer itself superimposed on a hosted base layer (in this case 
                        MapQuest OpenStreetMap). Explore this page, noting the various options available to you.

                        This page shows all maps known to GeoNode, available with similar viewing options as with the layers. 
                        Currently, there are no maps here, but we will create one later on in the workshop.

                        This page contains a wealth of options for customizing a search for various information on this GeoNode instance. 
                        While a simple search box is available at the top of every page, this search from allows for much more

                        can see the Permission section, where you can limit the access on your layer. Under Who can view and download 
                        this data, select Any registered user. This will ensure that anonymous view access is disabled. In the same area, 
                        under Who can edit this data, select your username. This will ensure that only you are able to edit the data in the layer.

                        To upload data, click the Upload button at the bottom.
